# PHOTIFY

## Description

Photify is a photo repository.

#### [Client-side Repository](https://github.com/rita-morozova/photos-repo-frontend)

#### [The demo can be viewed on Netlify](https://fall-photify.netlify.app/) 

### Main Features:
* Users can see all photos
* User authentication
* Users can add photos to the repository (secure uploading)
* Users can delete photos from the repository: users can not delete photos from another user (access control)

## Getting Started
- Fork and clone this repo
- Navigate to photosRepo-backend
- Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies 
- Run `rails db:create` & `rails db:migrate` to create a database
- Run `rails db:seed` (to seed the database with the test photos) 
- To be able to upload photos, you need to obtain a Cloudinary API key from [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and save `'cloud_name'`, `'cloud_api_key'`, and `'cloud_api_secret'` in `application.yml` file (create `application.yml` in `config` folder manually). Also, add `secret_key: 'yourKeyHere' ` to the application.yml for `login authentication`
- Start the server by running `rails s`
- Once the server is running, navigate to the [client-side repo](https://github.com/rita-morozova/photos-repo-frontend), fork and clone it. From the main directory run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the application
